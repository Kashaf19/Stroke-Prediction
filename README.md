🧠 Stroke Prediction Project
This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of a stroke in individuals based on their health attributes using machine learning techniques. Stroke is a serious medical condition that can lead to long-term disability or death, so early prediction is crucial for timely medical intervention.

📌 Project Objective
To build a reliable machine learning model that can analyze patient data and predict the risk of stroke with high accuracy. The model assists healthcare professionals and institutions in identifying high-risk individuals for early diagnosis and prevention.
