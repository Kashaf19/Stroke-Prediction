## 🧠 Stroke Prediction Project

This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of a stroke in individuals based on their health attributes using machine learning techniques. Stroke is a serious medical condition that can lead to long-term disability or death, so early prediction is crucial for timely medical intervention.

### 📌 Project Objective

To build a reliable machine learning model that can analyze patient data and predict the risk of stroke with high accuracy. The model assists healthcare professionals and institutions in identifying high-risk individuals for early diagnosis and prevention.

### 📊 Dataset

The dataset used is publicly available and contains records of patients along with the following features:

* Gender
* Age
* Hypertension
* Heart Disease
* Marital Status
* Work Type
* Residence Type
* Average Glucose Level
* BMI
* Smoking Status
* Stroke (Target Variable)

### ⚙️ Technologies & Tools

* Python
* Pandas, NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib & Seaborn (for EDA & visualization)
* Jupyter Notebook
* Machine Learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, etc.)

### 📈 Workflow

1. Data Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature Engineering
4. Model Training & Evaluation
5. Performance Comparison
6. Final Model Selection & Prediction

### ✅ Evaluation Metrics

* Accuracy
* Precision
* Recall
* F1-Score
* ROC-AUC Curve

### 📌 Key Highlights
